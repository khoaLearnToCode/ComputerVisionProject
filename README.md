SourceCode.ipynb: Merged source code with code from all 3 methods.  
positive.csv; negative.csv; positive_opencv_kmeans.csv; negative_opencv_kmeans.csv: CSV files contains the result from KMeans of all images in the dataset. Since it takes a long time to process through all 40.000 images, we stored them all for more convenience in finding a proper threshold later on.
